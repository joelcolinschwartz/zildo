# The Land of Alembrume

Tribute to old-fashioned game (especially Legend of Zelda : A link to the past), where a hero has a sword and a shield to save a captured princess, by visiting many castles.

This is OpenGL-based game. It can run on Android, and any computer which can run Java6. (it's not exactly true today, see this).

By now, it's in progress. The entire team is devoted to Alembrume's success. And sometimes, accomplish their personal life's duty, but this is occasional.
