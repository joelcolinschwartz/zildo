# How start an internet game ? #

There's an item in the "Multi player" menu, which is a toggle between LAN and www.

So, you have to select the following items:
  * Multi Player
  * Current network (to get 'www' instead of 'LAN')
  * Create game

**IMPORTANT** : your internet configuration need to have a specific port to be opened. In order to create a Zildo's server, you have to open the 1234 port with UDP from the outside.

  * 2 options :
    * if any server can be found, you must give the connection informations from the "Join game" menu (=> Add a new one). Name is purely indicative, but IP and port are mandatory. Ask the server's owner for them.
    * just pick the right server from the list (where you know that a friend of yours has started a game) and welcome in Zildo's arena !
