**Multiplatform limitations**

The technologies choice (Java, LWJGL) has been made in order to adress every platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) but there still exists some limitations.

Everything's fine on following configs:
  * Windows XP with any graphic card
  * Windows Vista/7 with NVIDIA card
  * MacOS X
  * Linux

Not working on:
  * Windows Vista/7 with some ATI cards (ATI drivers are not right for all ATI cards, Radeon 9600 for example)
