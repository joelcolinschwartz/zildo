/**
 * Draws a circle around a specific center (Zildo !).<br/>
 * 
 * Mathematical explanation:<p/>
 * 
 * Each point respecting following equation must be shown :<br/>
 * (x - a)² + (y - b)² > r² <p/>
 * 
 * So the screen is divided vertically into 3 areas :<ol>
 * <li>before circle : all is black</li>
 * <li>circle : each line has two roots from an equation derived from the first one
 * <li>after circle : all is black again</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * In order to calculate the derived equation, let's set a variable Y = (y - b)² <br/>
 * So we have: <br/>
 * (x - a)² + Y > r² <br/>
 * wich gives : <br/>
 * x² - 2ax + a² + Y - r² > 0 <p/>
 * 
 * If we calculate the delta : <br/>
 * D = (-2a)² - 4 * (a² + Y - r²) <br/>
 * D = 4 * (a² - r²)<p>
 * 
 * So we deduce the 2 roots of the equation : <br/>
 * x1 = (2 * a - sqrt(D)) / 2 <br/>
 * x2 = (2 * a + sqrt(D)) / 2 <br/>
